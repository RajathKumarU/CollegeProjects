			<span class="a-size-base">I would just point out some of the
				pros and cons that i noticed in this handset.<br />Some are good
				but some are really annoying but still better than competition.And
				after the price cut,its even better.<br />
			<br />‚úîSpecs are really amazing for the price.<br />‚úînot the
				lightest but Light in-spite of metal body.<br />‚úîdisplay is vibrant
				and viewing angle is awesome.<br />‚úîcamera is too good for the
				price both front and rear.(Low light lil bit shaky but still good.)<br />‚úîVery
				good gaming experience.butter smooth UI experience despite of some
				minor bugs [hope the update solves it]<br />‚úîIR blaster to control
				TVs, Set top boxes, A/C etc<br />‚úî Battery is simply awesome and
				simply better than expected.you can except more than a day battery
				backup if you are a moderate user.<br /> {battery updated below}<br />‚úîHeating:
				doesn't heat up usually , but i gets a little warm on using certain
				apps and games but i think its normal<br />bads are......<br />‚úîCapacitive
				buttons are backlit but lil difficult to use in Bright conditions<br />‚úîbiggest
				con is its 16gb internal memory which cannot be expanded further
				with MSD CARD..<br /> [ 12GB USER AVAILABLE ].64 gb is ok.<br />
				OTG Support: so that may not be a deal breaker for some folks at
				least.<br />‚úîNo NFC(its mentioned wrong in some websites )[i needed
				nfc because i have other nfc devices )<br />
			<br />üëç)Update {25-06-15}<br />
			<br />üëç)Just thought to make people informed about the following:<br />
			<br />#its not a dual sim device.No 4G support.(3G and 2G only)<br />#Its
				not waterproof but will survive to some extent.<br />#You can
				install windows 10 in the future if you want.<br />#No official
				lolipop update though You can always try out custom Roms.You can
				install stock lolipop ROM .<br />#Infra-red feature works like
				charm for remote controlling TV's<br />#Battery is not user
				replaceable<br /> #-----------------Quick battery backup
				results(its just an approximate)<br />The battery will last more
				than a day even if you are more than an average user.The onscreen
				time is pretty great.<br />You don't need to charge it twice a day
				with Data/wifi ON,with emails,social networking running in
				background.<br />But if you are a heavy gamer then better consider
				buying a 10kMAh power bank.<br />(This battery backup review is
				tested with custom ROM)<br />
			<br />üëç)OVERALL ITS A GREAT DEVICE
